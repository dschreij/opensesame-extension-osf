# Open Science Framework module for OpenSesame

This module intends to integrate functionality into the OpenSesame Experiment builder (http://osdoc.cogsci.nl | https://github.com/smathot/OpenSesame) with which it can connect and interact with the Open Science Framework (http://osf.io)

More documentation will soon follow!
